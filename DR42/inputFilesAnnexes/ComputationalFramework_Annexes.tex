\item\textbf{Abstract}:
In this paper, we present a computational framework for direct trajectory optimization of general manipulation systems with unspecified contact sequences, exploiting \emph{environmental constraints} as a key tool to accomplish a task.
Two approaches are presented to describe the dynamics of systems with contacts, which are based on a penalty formulation and on a velocity-based time-stepping scheme, respectively. In  both cases, object and environment contact forces are included among the free optimization variables, and they are rendered consistent via suitably devised sets of complementarity conditions.
To maximize computational efficiency, we exploit sparsity patterns in the linear algebra expressions generated during the solution of the optimization problem and leverage Algorithmic Differentiation to calculate derivatives. % quickly and accurately.
The benefits of the proposed methods are evaluated in three simulated planar manipulation tasks, where essential interactions with environmental constraints are automatically synthesized and opportunistically exploited.
\item \textbf{Relation with the deliverable}: grasp and manipulation planning for systems with a-priori unspecified contact sequences.
