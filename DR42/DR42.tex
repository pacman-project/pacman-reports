\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\noindent This report describes the activities related to the control of grasping actions given the detection of an object. It includes work on: modelling underactuated and adaptive robotic hands, acquiring target grasps learned from data gathered either from humans or simulations, synthesising grasps for novel objects using either heuristic or statistical machine learning approaches, planning complex grasping and manipulation tasks either using discrete search methods or via direct trajectory optimization methods for systems with unspecified contact sequences.

\section*{Executive Summary}

This report describes the activities --- most of which already performed, while some others scheduled for finalization in the weeks that precede the PaCMan review meeting in May 2015 --- within the PaCMan consortium to define methodologies for \emph{incipient grasping evaluation}. The material included in this report describes the results that fall under Task 4.2 (M 7-18), and the progress of Task 4.3 (M 7-30) at M 24.

\section*{Role of incipient grasps evaluation in PaCMan}

This deliverable documents the effort of the consortium in devising new strategies to define \emph{practical} approaches to tackle the problem of \emph{grasping under uncertainty}, either caused by clutter, visual occlusions, and new object shapes. To this sake, the ability to evaluate \emph{incipient grasps} in terms of their expected quality, robustness, and probability of success, is of paramount importance.

\section*{Contribution to the PaCMan scenario}

To our eyes, grasp methodologies that try to cope with pose uncertainty, object shape estimation inaccuracies, clutter and partial occlusions, either (i) by accomodating grasp unmodelled dynamics by exploiting prior knowledge about the adaptivity and the compliance of the Pisa/IIT SoftHand (as mainly proposed by the UNIPI Team), or (ii) by inferring grasps for novel objects from as little as one training example (of a chosen grasp type) that are shown to be generalizable within and \emph{across} object categories, even with partial shape information, (as mainly proposed by The UoB Team), represent central contributions in the scenario depicted in the PaCMan project.

\section{Tasks, objectives, results}

\subsection{Planned work}

Humans have no troubles in selecting the correct grasp strategies even if the object to be grasped is unknown or partially visible. On the contrary, though robotics has made significant progress in the field of autonomous grasping, the problem of grasping novel objects in cluttered scenarios has not been completely solved yet. In this report, we document the activities of the consortium to tackle this problem.

The work to be documented in this report regards: ``Methodologies for incipient grasp evaluation''. This should mostly contain the results of Task 4.2 and the progress of Task 4.3 and Task 4.4 at this stage. In particular, the report should contain a description of the procedures to infer first-order object surface properties and the quality of the associated grasp from fingerpad sensor recordings, and algorithms for local optimization of contact point locations and on-line grasping force optimization.

%% Input from Claudio
% In Task 4.4 we posed the problem of grasping as a problem of motion planning under uncertainty. We planned to implement and evaluate a motion planning algorithm in a physics based simulation, prior to transfer to a real robot. The requirement was for an algorithm that could provide robust reach to grasp trajectories in the face of object pose and shape uncertainty, planning for and taking advantage of tactile contacts. We considered both methods that plan explicitly in belief space, and those that embed information from observations in the physical space. We elected to pursue the latter route.


\subsection{Actual work performed}

We have to clearly state, right away, that not all the pieces of work presented in this report, even if sharing the very same goals of WP4, i.e., ``to develop methods to control grasping actions given a detection of an object using the compositional object model'', fit exactly the breakdown structure suggested by the Tasks reported in the ``Description of Work''. In particular, the description of the activities to be performed in Tasks 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, represents the sequential temporal stages that one could envision in performing a robust grasp when adopting a fully actuated and sensorized robotic hand. In fact, the pre-shaping of the hand to a first object contact (Task 4.1), the assessment of the first-order properties of the object surface, along with the local optimization of the contact point locations (Task 4.2), and the actual grasp acquisition with the optimal distribution of contact forces (Task 4.3), indeed assume that the action is performed by employing a dexterous hand with a plethora of force and position sensors. Moreover, here the robustness of the grasp was envisioned by reasoning, at each stage of the process, whether the previous step was successfully performed and taking proper corrective actions if that was not the case.

The approach that we came to pursue sees instead a central role of compliantly underactuated hands, where uncertainty in the relative pose between the hand and the object and object shape itself is mechanically absorbed by the adaptive behavior of the Pisa/IIT SoftHand. This new research direction brought about somewhat completely unplanned (and unexplored) issues that we considered central to the goals of WP4 and worth to be pursued. First of all, the sensorization of a compliantly adaptive hand with dislocable joints asked for a whole new approach to provide proprioceptive feedback to the hand (this topic is actually matter of D 3.1). The force sensorization problem, which is somewhat assumed in the Tasks 4.2 and 4.3, poses non trivial technological problems for the hand under investigation, and is still under development and testing. Moreover, the envisioned phases to transit from grasp formation to successful grasp acquisition are inextricably entangled and somehow blurred for an adaptive and underactuated hand with just one single Degree of Actuation, as the dynamic interaction between the hand and the object --- and possibly the environment --- is responsible for the global behavior of the system. This new perspective asked for a rescheduling and reorganization of the needed pieces of work.

For the reasons mentioned above, the work that is presented in this report is mostly focused on proposing robust grasping solution for an adaptive hand and, in particular, for our Pisa/IIT SoftHand. The learning and transfer of grasps within and across object categories, instead, makes use of the fully actuated and sensorized 20-DoF DLR-HIT Hand II, since a finer control over the fingertip position is required.

In Sec.~\ref{sec:GraspingWithSoftHands}, we present our approach to define successful synthetic poses for the Pisa/IIT SoftHand in grasping the PaCMan object database. In Sec.~\ref{sec:GraspPlanningBoundingBoxes}, the previous approach is sharpened by employing a custom decomposition into cuboids of the object point cloud. Each cuboid suggests a number of grasps to be performed on the object. These grasps are used to warm start the search for successful grasps to be synthetically found in the simulation environment and to be attached to that object's grasp database. The feasibility of using this approach on-line to find graspable parts on objects in the scene with partial point cloud information and irrespective to their prior recognition is under investigation.

In Sec.~\ref{sec:GraspingNovelObjects}, we shift our attention onto the generalization and adaptation ability of the previously reported grasp planning algorithm for fully actuated hands showing, in experiments using the DLR-HIT Hand II, how it is possible to just use a few example grasps, taught in a kinesthetic manner, in order to be able to transfer this knowledge to unknown, even partially visible objects.

In Sec.~\ref{sec:GraspingUncertainty}, we consider the grasps of the previous section as the starting point, but now wish to execute them more reliably than in an essentially open loop fashion. We present the progress on our method for planning tactile information gathering to reduce the uncertainty in the pose of an object. The method works by embedding the information to be gained in the physical space, using it to shorten distances, and thus make information gathering trajectories of lower cost. We show improvement in our results over the previous year.

Sec.~\ref{sec:SampleBasedMotionPlanningSoftRobots} presents a new approach to planning for soft robot manipulators under task constraints. This piece of work is central to motion planning in dual arm configurations, e.g. when an object is held simultaneously with two compliant underactuated hands. The corresponding control problem, which makes use of a geometric formulation and is based on a non-interacting scheme, is tested on a dual-arm (closed kinematic loop) configuration.

Sec.~\ref{sec:HighLevelPlanningDualArm} presents our approach to solve high-level planning for grasping an object and passing it from one hand to another. This work constitutes the theoretical foundation for the high-level planning needed to perform the Task 5.3.

In Sec.~\ref{sec:ComputationalFramework}, we describe a planning strategy based on direct trajectory optimization that does not require a-priori specification of the contact sequence and presents the benefits of providing dynamically consistent plans, from the outset, and allowing for opportunistic exploitation of environmental constraints.
