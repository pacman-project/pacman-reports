\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\noindent This report describes activities related to haptic object exploration methodologies. The object shape refinement and friction coefficient estimation require low-level controllers that allow contour tracing actions as well as a sophisticated sensorization of the exploratory probe. This report presents the efforts on providing controllers to perform sliding and rolling of a fingertip over a surface, integrating controllers with vision as the initial source of information, implementing a robust testbed to simulate results, and last but not least, specifying the designs on the sensorization of the Pisa/IIT soft hand.

\section*{Executive Summary}
\includegraphics[height=80pt]{pacmanlogo.png}\\
This report describes the activities within the PaCMan consortium to define methodologies for \emph{haptic object exploration}. The material included in this report shows the results of Task 3.1 (M 1-24), and the progress of Task 3.2 (M 1-36).

\section*{Role of haptic object exploration in PaCMan}

This deliverable reports the research done on finding a methodology to explore objects and gather their haptic properties such as the static and dynamic friction coefficient. To this end, \emph{control algorithms} and \emph{innovative sensors} are developed.

\section*{Contribution to the PaCMan scenario}

Within the project, there is the need to actively acquire information from objects to feed the multi-modal representation of an object to be developed in WP2. The exploratory strategies which combine low-level control algorithms developed by the UNIPI team and high-level decision making strategies developed by UoB team, together with a sensorized adaptive hand as proposed from the UNIPI team, make this possible.

Additionally, the developed algorithms make no assumption on how the gathered information is encoded. This provides a versatile testbed to contrast the representation coming from WP2 with other approaches.

\section{Tasks, objectives, results}

\subsection{Planned work}

This report must show the results of Task 3.1. Particularly, it should describe reactive control strategies for haptic exploration of an object by a robotic hand, consisting of contour tracing of the object's surface and finger rolling over the object surface, as well as strategies for extracting higher-order geometric features and frictional properties.

\subsection{Actual work performed}

We can proudly say that Task 3.1 has been fulfilled, and Sec.~\ref{sec:ControlAlgorithms} summarizes the results following the proposed activities.

%Sec.~\ref{sec:Simulation} describes the simulation environment that will be used to test the results of Tasks~3.1 and~3.2. The reason behind implementing another simulation environment different from the one presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:ControlAlgorithms} is the integration with vision and to the expected results from Task~3.2, which was acknowledge after obtaining the results of Task~3.1.

The fact that the object shape uncertainty is reduced by making contact with the object, combined with the adaptability of the Pisa/IIT SoftHand to any kind of surface, shaped the idea of using the hand as sophisticated exploratory probe. Sec.~\ref{sec:IMUGlove} ans~\ref{sec:SenseOfTouch} provide glove-inspired solutions to read the hand configuration as well as the contact information to estimate accurately the object shape as the result of grasping the object. The solution can help greatly in situations where only partial visual information is available, as challenged in Task 3.2, thus we believe that this research line deserves further attention as seems beneficial to accomplish the project goals.
