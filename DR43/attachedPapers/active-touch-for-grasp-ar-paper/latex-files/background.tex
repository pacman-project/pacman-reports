This work is related to the approach of the approach of Platt et al.~\citep{bib:platt_csail_2011}, ~\citep{bib:platt_icra_2012}. That work plans a sequence of actions that will generate observations that distinguish a hypothesised state from competing hypotheses while also reaching a goal position. Platt et al.  applied this to planning for a two degree of freedom manipulator using a laser range finder for observations, and employed an optimisation framework for planning. The algorithm is proved to localise the true state of the system in one dimension and to reach a goal region with high probability. In contrast to~\citep{bib:platt_csail_2011}, our approach encodes information gathering actions to localise an object to be grasped in six dimensions while simultaneously attempting to achieve the task of grasping.  Similarly to~\citep{bib:platt_csail_2011},~\citep{bib:platt_icra_2012}, this method is guaranteed to converge to the true state of the system in which a reach-to-grasp trajectory succeeds with high probability, under the assumption that the system is not perturbed by previous grasping attempts (e.g. the robot contacts the target object without changing its configuration).
