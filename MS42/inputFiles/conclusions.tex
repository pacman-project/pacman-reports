\section{Conclusions and Future Works}
The present work had the aim of implementing an extended set of different classes of controllers for the robotic arm KUKA LWR IV, exploiting a flexible system which is rapidly growing in the field of robotics, including research and whole industrial processes. In fact, all the code produced could not only be accessed and used from users operating the same robot, but ideally from everyone who works with ROS, at least performing some minor edits to fit their needs. Thinking about future works starting from this project, it could be interesting the extension to a bimanual system in a human-like arms configuration. For example, taking advantage of the Stack of Tasks framework could be also provided obstacle and collision avoidance, making easier the interaction between the robot and humans or the handling of more complex operations.
