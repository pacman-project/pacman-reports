\section{Milestone Summary and Context}

This milestone report describes the work performed to integrate planning and execution phases regarding to grasping and object exploration (milestone 4.2). The main contributions are 1) the technical implementation of hardware interfaces to command the KUKA LWR arm using ROS and 2)  the implementation of different classical controllers to move the robot using torque references.

The first contribution is useful to command the robot using torque commands easier that using the actual KUKA FRI interface. The second helps to execute trajectories coming from planning phase, and to move the robot to desired references under different situations such as dynamic model uncertainty and different redundancy resolution at kinematic and dynamic levels. These contributions have impact in the implementation of the PaCMan Scenarios and demos and will be used for high-level exploration planning.

% What was the milestone that you are examining? What were the criteria for achieving it? What role does achievement of the milestone play in the whole project? How will its achievement as presented in this report contribute to the PaCMan scenarios and prototypes?
