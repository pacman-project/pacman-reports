\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\noindent This report describes the activities related to the control of grasping actions given the detection of an object. It includes work on: modelling underactuated and adaptive robotic hands, acquiring target grasps learned from data gathered either from humans or simulations, synthesising grasps for novel objects using either heuristic or statistical machine learning approaches, planning complex grasping and manipulation tasks either using discrete search methods or via direct trajectory optimization methods for systems with unspecified contact sequences.

\section*{Executive Summary}

This report describes the activities --- most of which already performed, while some others scheduled for finalization in the weeks that precede the PaCMan review meeting in May 2015 --- within the PaCMan consortium to define methodologies for \emph{incipient grasping evaluation}. The material included in this report describes the results that fall under Task 4.2 (M 7-18), and the progress of Task 4.3 (M 7-30) at M 24.

\section*{Role of incipient grasps evaluation in PaCMan}

This deliverable documents the effort of the consortium in devising new strategies to define \emph{practical} approaches to tackle the problem of \emph{grasping under uncertainty}, either caused by clutter, visual occlusions, and new object shapes. To this sake, the ability to evaluate \emph{incipient grasps} in terms of their expected quality, robustness, and probability of success, is of paramount importance.

\section*{Contribution to the PaCMan scenario}

To our eyes, grasp methodologies that try to cope with pose uncertainty, object shape estimation inaccuracies, clutter and partial occlusions, either (i) by accomodating grasp unmodelled dynamics by exploiting prior knowledge about the adaptivity and the compliance of the Pisa/IIT SoftHand (as mainly proposed by the Unipi Team), or (ii) by inferring grasps for novel objects from as little as one training example (of a chosen grasp type) that are shown to be generalizable within and \emph{across} object categories, even with partial shape information, (as mainly proposed by The UoB Team), represent central contributions in the scenario depicted in the PaCMan project.

\section{Tasks, objectives, results}

\subsection{Planned work}

What tasks was the report supposed to address? What objectives, results were these tasks to achieve?

\subsection{Actual work performed}

What does the report actually present? How have the tasks been addressed? To what extent have the intended objectives been achieved? Why, how -- or why not?

% \subsection{Relation to the state-of-the-art}
% How are the obtained results related to the state-of-the-art?
% This part is usually discussed in the corresponding subsection. Therefore, % a global 'Relation to the state-of-the-art' is unnecessary
