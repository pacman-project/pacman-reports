\section*{Executive Summary}

This report describes...

\section*{Role of incipient grasps evaluation in PaCMan}

What role do the tasks addressed in this report play in the larger context of PaCMan? How do these tasks, how does report, contribute to achieving the overall goals for PaCMan?

\section*{Contribution to the PaCMan scenario}

How do the results presented in this report contribute to the PaCMan scenarios and prototypes?


\newpage

\section{Tasks, objectives, results}

\subsection{Planned work}

What tasks was the report supposed to address? What objectives, results were these tasks to achieve?

\subsection{Actual work performed}

What does the report actually present? How have the tasks been addressed? To what extent have the intended objectives been achieved? Why, how -- or why not?

% \subsection{Relation to the state-of-the-art}
% How are the obtained results related to the state-of-the-art?
% This part is usually discussed in the corresponding subsection. Therefore, % a global 'Relation to the state-of-the-art' is unnecessary
