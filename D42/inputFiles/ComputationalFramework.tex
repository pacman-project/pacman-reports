\subsubsection{A Computational Framework for Environment-Aware Robotic Manipulation Planning}

Moving beyond with respect to what we committed to investigate in Tasks 4.2 and 4.3, we present here a computational framework for direct trajectory optimization of general manipulation systems with \textsl{a-priori} unspecified contact sequences, possibly exploiting \emph{environmental constraints} as a tool to accomplish a task.
 
 Originally, we planned to approach the problem of robust grasping by dividing it in three main stages: (i) move from hand pre-shape to first object contact (Task 4.1), (ii) perform an incipient grasp and assess the first-order properties of the surface of the object (Task 4.2), and (iii) perform the actual grasp acquisition. In this section, we report on our effort to devise a framework to be employed not only for grasp planning, but also for manipulation planning and that should be able to merge all three previous phases.
