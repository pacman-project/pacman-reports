%%% Grasping With Soft Hands

\subsubsection{Grasping With Soft Hands}

In this section, we present a research topic started during the first year of the project --- it was already documented in DR 4.1 in the preliminary form of a technical report --- that has now reached a higher level of maturity, as testified by the accompanying paper~\cite{Bonilla:Humanoids:2015}. This topic is about how we tackle the problem of grasp planning for hands that are simple --- in the sense of low number of actuated degrees of freedom (one for the Pisa/IIT SoftHands) --- but are soft, i.e. continuously deformable in an infinity of possible shapes through interactions with objects.
